# Offensive-language-and-hate-speech-tweet-classification-

Part of a project that will use a councilor model to detect offensive language and hate speech in tweets. It includes:

  - A Voting classifier
  - An LSTM network
  - A Bayesian model
  - A Proximity model
 
 All of the outputs will then be averaged and each classifier's output will be assigned a weight depending on the class in which it has gotten the most accuracy. Finally, the weighted average will be calculated as the model's output.
